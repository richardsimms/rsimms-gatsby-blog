## European tour website
The PGA wanted a new website to showcase the live, at-event experience of their premiere golf stage - The European Tour.

This would be quite some feat because The European Tour competition is a year-long Race to Dubai, where the winner is crowned and covers 47 tournaments across 26 countries.

 ### Approach
 Working in small teams, we designed the site one section at a time. I lead a visual and UX team across key pages in five intensive two-week sprints.

 In each sprint, we defined and overcame challenges by interviewing stakeholders; refining ideas and presenting wireframes and flows to the client throughout.

 Employing InVisions Craft to keep the teams aligned and storing our component library in Zeplin, we built prototypes of the interactions; from micro-interactions to full page flows.

 These accompanied annotations and production access of the design ready to be built in Sitecore.

## Solution
We delivered a site with performance at its heart, to serve the fans with the first and fastest live scores and the latest news from nearly fifty tournaments around the world.

The multi-faceted site incorporates real-time leaderboards, video replays, galleries, player profiles and up-to-the-minute written word articles so golf fans can follow all the action as if they were teeing off next to the pros at The Masters or Ryder Cup themselves.
